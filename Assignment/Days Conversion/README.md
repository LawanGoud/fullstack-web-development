## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Days Conversion**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

âœ… Reads a number `N` (total days)
âœ… Converts it into:

- Years (1 year = 365 days)
- Weeks (1 week = 7 days)
- Remaining Days

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Integer division (`//`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Step-by-step breakdown

---

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
# Read total number of days
N = int(input())

# Calculate number of years
Y = N // 365

# Remaining days after years
remaining_days = N % 365

# Calculate number of weeks
W = remaining_days // 7

# Remaining days after weeks
D = remaining_days % 7

# Print the result
print(Y, "years", W, "weeks", D, "days")
```

## ðŸ§ª **Sample Input:**

```
1329
```

## ðŸ§¾ **Sample Output:**
