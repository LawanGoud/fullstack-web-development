## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Denominations - 4**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

- âœ… Reads an amount `A`.
- âœ… Calculates the **minimum number** of notes using denominations:

  - 100 rupee
  - 50 rupee
  - 20 rupee
  - 10 rupee

- âœ… Prints the count of each note.

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Integer division (`//`)
- Remainder (`%`)
- Step-by-step deduction using greedy method

---

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
A = int(input())  # Read the amount

hundreds = A // 100        # Number of 100 rupee notes
A = A % 100                # Remaining amount after 100s

fifties = A // 50          # Number of 50 rupee notes
A = A % 50                 # Remaining amount after 50s

twenties = A // 20         # Number of 20 rupee notes
A = A % 20                 # Remaining amount after 20s

tens = A // 10             # Number of 10 rupee notes
A = A % 10                 # Remaining amount after 10s

print("100 Notes:", hundreds)
print("50 Notes:", fifties)
print("20 Notes:", twenties)
print("10 Notes:", tens)
```

## ðŸ§ª **Sample Input:**

```
370
```

## ðŸ§¾ **Sample Output:**

```
100 Notes: 3
50 Notes: 1
