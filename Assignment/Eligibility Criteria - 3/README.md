## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Eligibility Criteria - 3**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:
âœ… Reads three integers `M`, `P`, and `C` (marks in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry)
âœ… Checks if **both** the following conditions are satisfied:

- âœ… All three marks are **greater than or equal to 35**
- âœ… **Any two** subject marks **sum to 90 or more**

âœ… Prints `True` or `False`

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)
- Comparison operators (`>=`)

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Solution**

### âœ… Step 1: Read the input values

```python
M = int(input())
P = int(input())
C = int(input())
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Check both conditions

1. **Each mark is at least 35**

```python
condition1 = M >= 35 and P >= 35 and C >= 35
```

2. **Any two subjects sum to at least 90**

```python
condition2 = (M + P >= 90) or (P + C >= 90) or (M + C >= 90)
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Final result

```python
result = condition1 and condition2
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Print the result

```python
print(result)
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input:

```
50
35
40
```

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```
True
```

---

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
M = int(input())
P = int(input())
C = int(input())

condition1 = M >= 35 and P >= 35 and C >= 35
condition2 = (M + P >= 90) or (P + C >= 90) or (M + C >= 90)

result = condition1 and condition2

print(result)
```
