## 🧩 **Problem Name:**

**Finding Difference**

---

## 🎯 **Goal:**

Write a program that:

✅ Reads two numbers
✅ Prints the **absolute difference** between them (without negative sign)

---

## 🧠 **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Arithmetic operations (`-`)
- `if-else` conditional to handle negative differences

---

## ✅ **Code:**

```python
# Read two numbers
A = int(input())
B = int(input())

# Check which is greater and subtract smaller from larger
if A > B:
    print(A - B)
else:
    print(B - A)
```
