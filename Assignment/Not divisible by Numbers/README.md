## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Not divisible by Numbers**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

âœ… Read a number `N`
âœ… Check if `N` is **not divisible** by all of these numbers: **2, 3, 5, 7**
âœ… Print `True` if **not divisible** by any of them
âœ… Otherwise, print `False`

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

* Remainder operator `%`
* Logical operator `and`
* Conditional statements (`if-else`)

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
# Read the number
N = int(input())

# Check if N is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7
if N % 2 != 0 and N % 3 != 0 and N % 5 != 0 and N % 7 != 0:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
```
