### ðŸ”º Simple Triangle - 3

**Task:**  
Write a program that prints a simple triangle using stars (`*`).

- The triangle should have **3 lines**
- Line 1 â†’ 1 star
- Line 2 â†’ 2 stars
- Line 3 â†’ 3 stars
- Each star should be followed by a space

---

### âœ… Python Code:

```python
print("*")
print("* *")
print("* * *")
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Output:

```
*
* *
* * *
```

---

### ðŸ§  Explanation:

- Each `print()` outputs a line with increasing number of stars.
- A space is added after each `*` to match the required format.
- This creates a left-aligned triangle shape of 3 rows.
