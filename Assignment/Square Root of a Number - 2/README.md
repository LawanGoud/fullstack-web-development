## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Square Root of a Number - 2**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

âœ… Read two numbers: `A` and `B`
âœ… Check if **square root of A is equal to B**

âœ… If true, print: `Square root of A is equal to B`
âœ… Otherwise, print: `Square root of A is not equal to B`

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

* Exponentiation operator `**`
* Conditional `if-else`
* Input and output

---

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
# Read the number A
A = int(input())

# Read the number B
B = int(input())

# Check if the square root of A is equal to B
if A ** 0.5 == B:
    print("Square root of A is equal to B")
else:
    print("Square root of A is not equal to B")
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input:

```
64  
8
```

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```
Square root of A is equal to B
```
