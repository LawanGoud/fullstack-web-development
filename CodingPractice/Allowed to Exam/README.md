  âœ… Use **nested conditionals**

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

* Input and output
* String comparison
* Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
* **Nested conditional blocks**

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Solution:**

### âœ… Step 1: Read inputs

```python
H = input()
I = input()
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Check conditions using nested `if`

```python
if H == "Y":
    print("Allowed to Exam - Has Hall ticket")
else:
    if I == "Y":
        print("Allowed to Exam - Has Identification Card")
```
