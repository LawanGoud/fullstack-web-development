## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Average of the N Numbers**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

âœ… Read a number `N`
âœ… Calculate the average of numbers from 1 to N
âœ… Print the average

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input and output
- While loop
- Arithmetic operations
- Variables

## ðŸ§® **Formula Used:**

Average of N numbers from 1:

```
Average = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N) / N
        = Sum of N numbers / N
```

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
# Read the number N
limit = int(input())

# Initialize the starting number and sum
number = 1
total = 0

# Loop to calculate the sum from 1 to N
while number <= limit:
    total = total + number
    number = number + 1

# Calculate the average
average = total / limit

# Print the result
print(average)
```
