## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Compare Numbers - 7**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:
âœ… Reads a **four-digit number** as a string
âœ… Checks if:

- The **first two digits** are equal to `19`, and
- The **last two digits** are **between 30 and 60 (inclusive)**

âœ… Prints `True` or `False`

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- String slicing (`[:2]`, `[2:]`)
- Type conversion: `int()`
- Logical operators (`and`)
- Comparison operators

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Solution**

### âœ… Step 1: Read the number as a string

```python
N = input()
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Extract parts using slicing

```python
first_two = N[:2]       # First two characters
last_two = int(N[2:])   # Convert last two characters to integer
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Check the condition

```python
result = (first_two == "19") and (30 <= last_two <= 60)
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Print the result

```python
print(result)
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input:

```
1947
```

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```
True
```

---

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
N = input()

first_two = N[:2]
last_two = int(N[2:])

result = (first_two == "19") and (30 <= last_two <= 60)

print(result)
```
