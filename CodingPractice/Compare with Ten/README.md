## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Compare with Ten**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:
âœ… Reads two integers `A` and `B`
âœ… Checks if **any** of the following conditions is satisfied:

- The **sum** of `A` and `B` is **less than 10**
- The **difference** between `A` and `B` is **less than 10**
- `A` is **between 5 and 30** (inclusive)

âœ… Prints `True` or `False`

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction
- Logical operator: `or`
- Relational comparisons
- Absolute value with `abs()`

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Solution**

### âœ… Step 1: Read input values

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Evaluate the three conditions

1. Sum less than 10:

   ```python
   A + B < 10
   ```

2. Absolute difference less than 10:

   ```python
   abs(A - B) < 10
   ```

3. A between 5 and 30 (inclusive):

   ```python
   5 <= A <= 30
   ```

Combine all with `or`:

```python
result = (A + B < 10) or (abs(A - B) < 10) or (5 <= A <= 30)
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Print the result

```python
print(result)
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input:

```
12
8
```

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```
True
```

---

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())

# Check conditions
result = (A + B < 10) or (abs(A - B) < 10) or (5 <= A <= 30)

print(result)
```
