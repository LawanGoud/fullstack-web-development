## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Denominations - 3**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

- âœ… Reads an amount `A`
- âœ… Calculates the **minimum number** of:

  - â‚¹500 notes
  - â‚¹50 notes
  - â‚¹10 notes
  - â‚¹1 coins

- âœ… Prints the count of each denomination in **one line**

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Integer division (`//`)
- Modulo/remainder (`%`)
- Step-by-step breakdown of amount using denominations

---

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
A = int(input())  # Read the amount

notes_500 = A // 500
remaining = A % 500

notes_50 = remaining // 50
remaining = remaining % 50

notes_10 = remaining // 10
remaining = remaining % 10

notes_1 = remaining

print("500:", notes_500, "50:", notes_50, "10:", notes_10, "1:", notes_1)
```

## ðŸ§ª **Sample Input:**

```
1543
```

## ðŸ§¾ **Sample Output:**

```
500: 3 50: 0 10: 4 1: 3
```
