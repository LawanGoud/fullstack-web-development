## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Denominations**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

- âœ… Reads an amount `A`
- âœ… Calculates the **minimum number** of:

  - â‚¹5 notes
  - â‚¹1 coins

- âœ… Prints the count of â‚¹5 and â‚¹1 notes separately.

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Integer division (`//`)
- Remainder (`%`)
- Arithmetic operations

---

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
A = int(input())  # Read the total amount

notes_5 = A // 5       # Find how many â‚¹5 notes
remaining = A % 5      # Remaining amount after using â‚¹5 notes
notes_1 = remaining    # All remaining is covered by â‚¹1 notes

print("5 :", notes_5)
print("1:", notes_1)
```

## ðŸ§ª **Sample Input:**

```
16
```

## ðŸ§¾ **Sample Output:**

```
5 : 3
1: 1
```
