## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Divisible by 10 or 5**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

* âœ… Reads a number `N`
* âœ… Checks:

  * If `N` is divisible by `10` â†’ Print `"Divisible by 10"`
  * Else if `N` is divisible by `5` â†’ Print `"Divisible by 5"`
  * Else â†’ Print `"Not Divisible by 10 or 5"`

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

* Input/output
* Integer division and remainder (`%`)
* Nested conditionals

---

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
N = int(input())

if N % 10 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 10")
else:
    if N % 5 == 0:
        print("Divisible by 5")
    else:
        print("Not Divisible by 10 or 5")
```
