## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Find the Group (Alternating Pattern)**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

- âœ… Reads a number `N` (between 1 and 30)
- âœ… Finds which **group** it belongs to:

  - Group 1 â†’ 1, 7, 13, 19, 25
  - Group 2 â†’ 2, 8, 14, 20, 26
  - Group 3 â†’ 3, 9, 15, 21, 27
  - Group 4 â†’ 4, 10, 16, 22, 28
  - Group 5 â†’ 5, 11, 17, 23, 29
  - Group 6 â†’ 6, 12, 18, 24, 30

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Modulo operator `%`
- Handling zero case with condition

---

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
N = int(input())  # Read the number

# Find the group number using modulo
group = N % 6

# If remainder is 0, it belongs to Group 6
if group == 0:
    group = 6

print("Group", group)
```

## ðŸ§ª **Sample Input:**

```
29
```

## ðŸ§¾ **Sample Output:**

```
Group 5
```
