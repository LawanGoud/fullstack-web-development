## 🧩 **Problem Name:**

**Find the Remainder**

---

## 🎯 **Goal:**

Write a program that:
✅ Reads two numbers `A` and `B`
✅ Prints the **remainder** when `A` is divided by `B`

---

## 🧠 **Concepts Used:**

✅ `input()`
✅ `int()`
✅ Modulus operator `%`

---

## 🪜 **Step-by-Step Solution**

### ✅ Step 1: Read the numbers

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Print the remainder

```python
print(A % B)
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Input:

```
10  
3
```

### 🧾 Sample Output:

```
1
```

---

## ✅ Full Code:

```python
# Read first number
A = int(input())

# Read second number
B = int(input())

# Print the remainder when A is divided by B
print(A % B)
```
