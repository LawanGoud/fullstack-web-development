## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Greater than 100**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:
âœ… Reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`
âœ… Checks if **each number** is **greater than 100**
âœ… If **all three** numbers are greater than 100, print:

```
All are greater than 100
```

âœ… Otherwise, print:

```
Not all the greater than 100
```

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

* Input reading using `input()`
* Type conversion using `int()`
* Logical operator `and`
* Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Solution**

### âœ… Step 1: Read three numbers as input

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Check the condition

```python
if A > 100 and B > 100 and C > 100:
    print("All are greater than 100")
else:
    print("Not all the greater than 100")
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input:

```
110  
256  
6350
```

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```
All are greater than 100
```

---

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
# Read three numbers from input
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())

# Check if all three numbers are greater than 100
if A > 100 and B > 100 and C > 100:
    # If all are greater than 100, print the message
    print("All are greater than 100")
else:
    # If any number is not greater than 100, print this message
    print("Not all the greater than 100")
```
