## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Greatest Remainder (Divide by 4 and 5)**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:
âœ… Reads a number `N`
âœ… Finds:

* Remainder when `N` is divided by `4`
* Remainder when `N` is divided by `5`
  âœ… Prints the **greater** of the two remainders

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

* Modulus operator (`%`)
* Comparison using `if-else`
* Input and output

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Solution**

### âœ… Step 1: Read the number

```python
N = int(input())
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Find remainders

```python
r1 = N % 4  
r2 = N % 5
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Compare remainders and print the greater

```python
if r1 > r2:
    print(r1)
else:
    print(r2)
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input:

```
12
```

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```
2
```

---

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
# Read the number
N = int(input())

# Find remainder when N is divided by 4
r1 = N % 4

# Find remainder when N is divided by 5
r2 = N % 5

# Compare and print the greater remainder
if r1 > r2:
    print(r1)
else:
    print(r2)
```
