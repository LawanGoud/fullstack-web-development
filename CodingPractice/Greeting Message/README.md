## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Comparison operators
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Logical OR (`or`) operator

## âœ… **Code with Comments and Explanation:**

```python
# Read the current time as an integer (0 to 23)
current_hour = int(input())  # Example: 9

# Check if time is between 4 and 12 (exclusive of 12)
if current_hour >= 4 and current_hour < 12:
    print("Good Morning")

# Check if time is between 12 and 16 (exclusive of 16)
elif current_hour >= 12 and current_hour < 16:
    print("Good Afternoon")

# Check if time is between 16 and 20 (exclusive of 20)
elif current_hour >= 16 and current_hour < 20:
    print("Good Evening")

# For any other time, it's Good Night
else:
    print("Good Night")
```
