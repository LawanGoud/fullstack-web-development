### ğŸ‘‹ Hello World (Custom Word)

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that:

- Takes a word `W` as input
- Prints **"Hello"** followed by the given word on the same line

---

### âœ… Python Code:

```python
W = input()
print("Hello " + W)
```

---

### ğŸ§  Explanation:

1. `input()` reads a single word from the user and stores it in the variable `W`.
2. `"Hello " + W` uses **string concatenation** to join the word with `"Hello "`.
3. `print()` displays the full message.

---

### ğŸ§ª Example:

**Input:**

```
Ravi
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Ravi
```

---

> ğŸ’¡ The space after `"Hello "` ensures proper formatting in the output.
