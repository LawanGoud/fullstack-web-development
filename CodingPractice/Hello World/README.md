## üìù Hello World

**Task:**
Write a program that prints **"Hello World"** as output.

---

## ‚úÖ Code

```python
print("Hello World")
```

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Start the Program**

- Python starts reading your code from the top.
- In this case, there's only **one line**, so it goes directly to that line.

---

### 2. **`print()` Function**

- `print` is a **built-in function** in Python.
- It is used to **display output on the screen**.
- Python knows that whenever it sees `print(...)`, it should display whatever is inside the parentheses `()`.

---

### 3. **What‚Äôs Inside the Parentheses?**

```python
"Hello World"
```

- This is a **string** ‚Äî a sequence of characters inside **quotes**.
- In Python, anything written between double (`" "`) or single (`' '`) quotes is treated as **text**, not a command or calculation.

---

### 4. **Quotes Are Important**

- If you write `Hello World` without quotes, Python will get confused and throw an error.
- The quotes tell Python: **‚ÄúThis is plain text to show on the screen.‚Äù**

---

### 5. **Executing the Print Statement**

- Python now runs the `print()` function and takes `"Hello World"` as input.
- It sends that text to the output screen.

---

### 6. **Output on the Screen**

The result you see:

```
Hello World
```

That‚Äôs the exact string you told Python to print.

## üîö End of Program

Since this is a single-line program, once the line is executed, the program ends.
