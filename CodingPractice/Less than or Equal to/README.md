## 🧩 **Problem Name:**

**Less than or Equal to**

---

## 📝 **Task:**

Write a program that:

- Takes **two inputs**:

  - First input is an **integer**
  - Second input is a **float**

- Checks if the first number is **less than or equal to** the second number
- Prints the result (`True` or `False`)

---

## 🧠 **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

### ✅ Step 1: Read the first number as an integer

```python
a = int(input())
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Read the second number as a float

```python
b = float(input())
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Use the relational operator `<=` to compare

```python
result = a <= b
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Print the result

```python
print(result)
```
