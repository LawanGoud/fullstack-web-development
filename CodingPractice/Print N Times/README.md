## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Print N Times**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

âœ… Reads a number `N`
âœ… Prints the number `0`, exactly `N` times, each on a new line

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input and output
- `while` loop
- Counters and repetition logic

---

## âœ… **Code:**

```python
# Read the number of times to print 0
number_of_times = int(input())

# Initialize counter
count = 0

# Repeat while counter is less than number_of_times
while count < number_of_times:
    print(0)              # Print 0
    count = count + 1     # Increment counter
```
