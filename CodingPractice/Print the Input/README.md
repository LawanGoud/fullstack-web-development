# 🖨️ Print the Input

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that reads a single line of input and then prints that input.

---

## ✅ Python Code:

```python
user_input = input()
print(user_input)
```

---

## 🧠 Explanation:

1. `input()` is used to take input from the user.
2. The input is stored in a variable named `user_input`.
3. `print(user_input)` displays the same input back on the screen.

---

## 🧪 Example:

**Input:**

```
Hello Python!
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Python!
```

---

> 💡 This is useful when you just want to echo user input or test input/output behavior.

```

Let me know if you'd like to expand this into taking multiple inputs or adding labels to the output!
