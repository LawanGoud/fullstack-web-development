### 🔁 Print the Reverse Order

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that:

- Reads **two lines of input**
- Prints them in **reverse order** (second line first, then the first line)

---

### ✅ Python Code:

```python
line1 = input()
line2 = input()
print(line2)
print(line1)
```

---

### 🧠 Explanation:

1. `input()` reads two lines and stores them in `line1` and `line2`.
2. To reverse the order, we print `line2` first, then `line1`.

---

### 🧪 Example:

**Input:**

```
Good Morning
Python Learner
```

**Output:**

```
Python Learner
Good Morning
```

---

> 💡 This is helpful in scenarios where input order matters but needs to be flipped for output or processing.
