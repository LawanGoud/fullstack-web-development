## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Print the Score - 2**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

- âœ… Reads a number `D` â†’ Distance in kilometers

- âœ… Calculates score based on:

  - For first 50 km â†’ `3 points per km`
  - For distance above 50 km â†’ `5 points per km`

- âœ… Prints the total score.

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Conditional statements
- Basic arithmetic

---

## âœ… **Code with Comments:**

```python
# Read the distance in kilometers
distance_km = int(input())

# Check if distance is less than or equal to 50
if distance_km <= 50:
    # If within first 50 km, score is 3 points per km
    total_score = distance_km * 3
else:
    # First 50 km â†’ 3 points per km = 50 * 3
    score_first_50 = 50 * 3

    # Remaining km â†’ 5 points per km
    extra_km = distance_km - 50
    score_extra = extra_km * 5

    # Total score is sum of both
    total_score = score_first_50 + score_extra

# Print the final score
print(total_score)
```
