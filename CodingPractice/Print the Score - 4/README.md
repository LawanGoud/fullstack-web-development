## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Print the Score - 4**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:

âœ… Reads a number `D` (distance in km)
âœ… Calculates total score using:

- First 40 km â†’ `2 points/km`
- Next 20 km (41â€“60) â†’ `4 points/km`
- Next 60 km (61â€“120) â†’ `6 points/km`
- Beyond 120 km â†’ `8 points/km`
  âœ… Adds a fixed **bonus of 50** to the final score
  âœ… Prints the total score

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- Conditional statements
- Arithmetic operations
- Step-wise cumulative scoring
- Bonus addition

---

## âœ… **Code with Comments:**

```python
# Read the distance as an integer
distance_km = int(input())

# Initialize total score
total_score = 0

# Fixed bonus
bonus = 50

# Case 1: Distance up to 40 km
if distance_km <= 40:
    total_score = distance_km * 2

# Case 2: Distance between 41 and 60 km
elif distance_km <= 60:
    score_40 = 40 * 2
    extra_km = distance_km - 40
    score_extra = extra_km * 4
    total_score = score_40 + score_extra

# Case 3: Distance between 61 and 120 km
elif distance_km <= 120:
    score_40 = 40 * 2
    score_20 = 20 * 4
    extra_km = distance_km - 60
    score_extra = extra_km * 6
    total_score = score_40 + score_20 + score_extra

# Case 4: Distance above 120 km
else:
    score_40 = 40 * 2
    score_20 = 20 * 4
    score_60 = 60 * 6
    extra_km = distance_km - 120
    score_extra = extra_km * 8
    total_score = score_40 + score_20 + score_60 + score_extra

# Add bonus to total score
total_score += bonus

# Print the final score
print(total_score)
```
