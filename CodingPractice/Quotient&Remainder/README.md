## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Quotient & Remainder**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Write a program that:
âœ… Reads two numbers `A` and `B`
âœ… Computes:

* **Quotient** = `A // B`
* **Remainder** = `A % B`
  âœ… Prints the quotient and remainder (each on a new line)

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

* Integer division (`//`)
* Modulus operator (`%`)
* Input and output

---

## ðŸªœ **Step-by-Step Solution**

### âœ… Step 1: Read two numbers

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Compute and print quotient and remainder

```python
print(A // B)  # Quotient
print(A % B)   # Remainder
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Input:

```
5  
2
```

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```
2  
1
```

---

## âœ… Full Code:

```python
# Read the first number
A = int(input())

# Read the second number
B = int(input())

# Print the quotient of A divided by B
print(A // B)

# Print the remainder of A divided by B
print(A % B)
```
