### ðŸ“„ Second Line

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that:

- Reads **two lines** of input
- Prints **only the second line**

---

### âœ… Python Code:

```python
line1 = input()
line2 = input()
print(line2)
```

---

### ðŸ§  Explanation:

1. `input()` is used twice to read two lines.
2. `line1` stores the first line (but we don't use it).
3. `line2` stores the second line and is printed using `print()`.

---

### ðŸ§ª Example:

**Input:**

```
First line of text
Second line of text
```

**Output:**

```
Second line of text
```

---

> âœ… Use this approach anytime you need to skip the first input and only work with the second.
