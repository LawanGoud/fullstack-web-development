Write a program that:

- Reads a **string** where:

  - The first **2 characters** are letters.

## ðŸ§  Concept Explanation

We are told:

- First 2 characters are **letters**.

We can use **string slicing** to extract the part from **index 2 to the end** of the string:

```python
digits = code[2:]
```

code = input()
```

### Step 2: Extract from index 2 to the end

```python
digits = code[2:]
```

### Step 3: Print the digits part

```python
print(digits)
```

## âœ… Final Code

```python
code = input()
print(code[2:])
```
