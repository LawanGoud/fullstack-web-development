### 🔲 Simple Square - 2 (with Spaces)

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that prints a simple 2×2 square using stars (`*`) with a **space after every star**.

---

### ✅ Python Code:

```python
print("* *")
print("* *")
```

---

### 🧠 Explanation:

- Each line prints: `*` followed by a space, then another `*`.
- Repeating this on two lines forms a square with spacing.

---

### 🖨️ Output:

```
* *
* *
```

---

> 💡 Spaces improve readability in star patterns. You’ll see this technique often in pyramid and grid patterns.
