### 🔲 Simple Square

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that prints a simple 2×2 square using asterisks (`*`), with two stars on the first line and two on the second.

---

### ✅ Python Code:

```python
print("**")
print("**")
```

---

### 🧠 Explanation:

1. Each `print("**")` call prints a line with **two asterisks**.
2. By doing it twice, you form a **2×2 square** of stars.

---

### 🖨️ Output:

```
**
**
```

---

> 💡 In Python, the `*` character is just a normal symbol inside quotes—so `print("**")` prints two stars literally.
