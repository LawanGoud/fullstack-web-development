### ‚ûñ Subtract 1 from String Length

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that:

- Reads a word as input
- Calculates the **length** of the word
- Prints the result of `length - 1`

---

### ‚úÖ Python Code:

```python
word = input()
length = len(word)
print(length - 1)
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- `input()` reads the word as a string.
- `len(word)` gives the total number of characters.
- We subtract `1` from the length and print the result.

Python
```
