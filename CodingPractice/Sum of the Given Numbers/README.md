## ðŸ§© **Problem Name:**

**Sum of the Given Numbers**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

âœ… Read a number `N`
âœ… Read `N` integer inputs
âœ… Find their **sum**
âœ… Print the result

---

## ðŸ§  **Concepts Used:**

- Input/output
- `while` loop
- Addition
- Counter and accumulator

---

## âœ… **Code with Explanation:**

```python
# Read how many numbers we need to sum
total_numbers = int(input())

# Start the sum from 0 (additive identity)
sum_of_numbers = 0

# Set the counter to start from 1
count = 1

# Loop to read N numbers
while count <= total_numbers:
    current_number = int(input())      # Read each number
    sum_of_numbers = sum_of_numbers + current_number  # Add it to sum
    count = count + 1                  # Move to next number

# Print the final sum
print(sum_of_numbers)
```
