## 📝 Three Hashes

**Task:**
Write a program that prints **three hash symbols (###)** as output.

---

## ✅ Code

```python
print("###")
```

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Start the Program**

- Python starts executing your code from the top.
- In this case, there is only one instruction — the `print()` statement.

---

### 2. **Understanding `print()`**

- `print()` is a **built-in Python function** used to display output on the screen.
- Anything placed inside the parentheses `()` will be printed (shown) to the user.

---

### 3. **What’s Inside the Parentheses?**

```python
"###"
```

- This is a **string** — a piece of text inside double quotes.
- Python treats `"###"` as plain text, **not** a command or a calculation.

---

### 4. **The Text: "###"**

- The text contains **three hash symbols** with no spaces in between.
- Because it's a string, Python will print it exactly as it is.

---

### 5. **Executing the Statement**

- Python executes `print("###")` by:

  - Calling the `print()` function.
  - Taking the string `"###"` as input.
  - Displaying it on the screen.

---

### 6. **Output on the Screen**

```
###
```

This is the final result printed on your screen — **three hash symbols**.
