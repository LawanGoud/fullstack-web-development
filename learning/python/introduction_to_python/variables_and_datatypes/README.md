# Variables and Data Types

## 🧮 Variables

- Variables are like **containers** that store information (data) in a program.
- You can think of a variable as a **label** for a value.
- The value stored in a variable **can change** over time.

### 🔧 Example:

```python
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10

x = 20
print(x)  # Output: 20
```

> The variable `x` first stores 10, then later it stores 20. The old value is replaced.

## 📦 Values

- A **value** is the actual **information or data** that a variable holds.
- In programming, values can be numbers, text, or other types of data.
- When you assign something to a variable, you're giving it a **value**.

### 🧠 Example:

```python
name = "Alice"   # "Alice" is the value
age = 25         # 25 is the value
```

In the example above:

- `name` is a variable that holds the **value** `"Alice"`
- `age` is a variable that holds the **value** `25`

## 📊 Data Types in Python

In programming, every piece of data has a **type**. This is called a **data type**.

A **data type** tells the computer:

- What kind of value is stored
- What operations can be done on that value

## 🔹 Common Data Types in Python

### 1. **String (`str`)**

A **String** is a sequence (stream) of characters enclosed within **single (' ')** or **double (" ")** quotes.

#### What can be in a String?

- Capital Letters: A–Z
- Small Letters: a–z
- Digits: 0–9
- Special Characters: `~ ! @ # $ % ^ . ? ,`
- Spaces

#### ✅ Examples:

```python
"Hello World!"
"some@example.com"
"1234"
'hello'
"hello"
```

---

### 2. **Integer (`int`)**

An **Integer** is any **whole number** (positive, negative, or zero) without a decimal point.

#### ✅ Examples:

```python
-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
```

---

### 3. **Float (`float`)**

A **Float** is a number that includes a **decimal point**.

#### ✅ Examples:

```python
24.3
345.210
-321.86
```

---

### 4. **Boolean (`bool`)**

A **Boolean** value has only **two possible options** — like:

- `True` or `False`
- `Yes` or `No`
- `On` or `Off`
- `1` or `0`

In **Python**, Booleans are written as:

```python
True
False
```

> 📝 **Note:** Boolean values must start with a capital letter (`T` and `F`) in Python.

## 🖊️ Assigning Values to Variables

In Python, you can assign a value to a variable using the **equals sign (`=`)**.

### ✅ Example:

```python
age = 10
```

- `age` is the variable
- `10` is the value
- `=` is the **assignment operator**

It means:
"Assign the value `10` to the variable `age`."
